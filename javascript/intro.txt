INTRO

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities that
gives interactivity to the static web pages. Javascript was developed by Netscape in 1995.
Its an open source and works across all major browsers.

JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.


ADVANTAGES

Less server interaction: You can validate user input before sending the page off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your server. 
Rich Interface and Immediate feedback to the visitors are few of them.


DISADVANTAGES

Cannot read files. No multithreading concepts.

EXTERNAL JAVASCRIPT

<script src="myScript.js"></script>
External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.


WHERE TO PLACE JS CODE?

This completely depends upon the requrements.
Placing in Head:
If we place the JS code on the head, then the code is executed before body loads. Hence if any tags
are calling JS from body then our JS code will always be available.

EG.
<html><head><title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<a href="javascript:myFunction();">Click here</a>
<script language="javascript" type="text/javascript">
function myFunction() {
	alert('Hello world');
}
</script>
</body>
</html>

Here if the user manages to click the link "Click here" before the function has loaded then it
will throw and error.

Placing at the end of body:
But if we have a javascript code that does some DOM manipulation or accessing some values from webpage
then its best to keep the JS code after body tag, as all DOM elements will be available to our JS code
.

Hence, we can conclude that if our javascript code has to do some DOM manipulation, then its good to palce JS code 
at the bottom as all the tags will be loaded. But if we are to execute our JS codebased on some HTML tags, 
then its best to keep our JS code in the head.


STATEMENTS

If we are js statements in different line, then semicolon is optional but if we write more than
one statements in the same line then semicolon is required. Eg.

Semicolon not required.
var1 = 10
var2 = 20

Semicolon required.
var1 = 10; var2 = 20;

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
    "Hello Dolly."; //Works in javascript

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello \
    Dolly!"; //also works, to split strings


 COMMENTS

 Javascript supports single line and multipline comments,eg // and /* */.
 It also recognizes HTML comments, that means, if any HTML tags are placed in comments then JS cannot 
 access them.


 ** If a javascript is disabled in the browser. But if we want to show some messages to the user then
 we can use <noscript> tags. Eg.

 	<noscript>
  		Sorry...JavaScript is needed to go ahead.
	</noscript>


VARIABLES

Javascript supports three types of data type and they are Number, Strings, Boolean.
They also support Objects. Both int and float are Number in JS.


If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value.
var carName = "Volvo"; 
var carName; 
console.log(carName)    //prints volvo

var carName = "Volvo"; 
var carName = "avi"; 
console.log(carName)    //prints avi

if you add a number to a string, both will be treated as strings.
console.log(2+"3"+4+5); gives 2345
Where as
console.log(1+2+"3"+4+5); gives 3344

When a JavaScript variable is declared with the keyword "new", the variable is created as an object.
var x = new String();          // Declares x as a String object
var y = new Number();          // Declares y as a Number object
var z = new Boolean();         // Declares z as a Boolean object

There are two types of variables in JS
1. Local : Defined inside a function and its scope is inside the function.
2. Global: Defined outside/inside the function with scope throughout the page.

If we declare a variable inside a function without a keyword var, then it will
be a global variable.


UNDEFINED AND NULL

undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
Eg. 
var x;
console.log(x);

null is an assignment value. It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value or empty.
var x = null;
console.log(x);

The typeof undefined itself is undefined whereas the typeof null is object.

NaN

NaN is a JavaScript reserved word indicating that a value is not a number.
var x = 100 / "Apple";  // x will be NaN (Not a Number)
var x = 100 / "10";     // x will be 10
You can use the global JavaScript function isNaN() to find out if a value is a number.
var x = 100 / "Apple";
isNaN(x);               // returns true because x is Not a Number
Watch out for NaN. If you use NaN in a mathematical operation, the result will also be NaN.
NaN is a number: typeOf NaN returns number.

toString() returns a number as a string.
Eg. x.toString();

toPrecision() returns a string, with a number written with a specified length
x.toPrecision();        // returns 9.656
x.toPrecision(2);       // returns 9.7
x.toPrecision(4);       // returns 9.656
x.toPrecision(6);       // returns 9.65600

parseInt and Number are used to convert string to number.
The difference being as follows:
var x = "10 10";
Number(x);        // returns NaN
parseInt(x);   // returns 10
parseInt("10avishek"); //returns 10
parseInt("years 10");   // returns NaN

The unary + operator can be used to convert a variable to a number.
var y = "5";      // y is a string
var x = + y;      // x is a number

var y = "John";   // y is a string
var x = + y;      // x is a number (NaN)


Avoid Using eval()
The eval() function is used to run text as code. In almost all cases, it should not be necessary to use it.
Because it allows arbitrary code to be run, it also represents a security problem.
Eg. eval("console.log('aa')"); gives aa as output.

If we want our JS code to be executed when the page is loaded
var readyStateCheckInterval = setInterval(function() {
    if (document.readyState === "complete" || document.readyState === "interactive") {
        console.log("DONE");
        clearInterval(readyStateCheckInterval);
    }
}, 1000);
