Introduction

Spring is a light weight and open source framework created by Rod Johnson in 2003.	Spring is a 
complete and a modular framework, meaning Spring can used to implement all the layers of an 
application or it can be used to implement only particular layer of an application. Eg, Struts
is basically used for front end layers and Hybernate is basically used for database layer, but
Spring can be used for any layers. 

Spring is light weight framework because of its POJO model. POJO is an acronym for Plain Old
Java Object, meaning, its just a simple class that does not follow any Object models or any 
conventions.

If we consider Java Beans, then they are classes that follow specific rules like constructor 
should not have any arguements, the properties of the class are set and accessed by using only
getter and setter methods and the class must be Serializable. 


Benefits of Spring

1. Testability
	The Spring applications are loosely coupled because of dependency injection. Hence, its very easy
	to test a module as it is loosely coupled or independent of other modules.
	
	Actually for writing the spring application, server [Container] is not mandatory, but for  struts
	applications we need a server, and for EJB too.  If we want to test the application it may need 
	lot of changes in the source and each time we must restart the server to view the changes, which 
	is little tedious and time taking but we can over come this in Spring,as for testing spring application 
	server is not mandatory spring has it own container to run the applications.
	Spring can be used to develop any kind of java application, meaning we can develop  console application to 
	enterprise level application

2. Organize
	Spring is organized in a modular fashion. Even though the number of packages and classes are 
	substantial, you have to worry only about ones you need and ignore the rest.

3. Predefined Templates
	Spring framework provides templates for JDBC, Hibernate, JPA etc. technologies. So there is no 
	need to write too much code. It hides the basic steps of these technologies.
	

The modular diagram of Spring is given in the image.

Describing the modular diagram of the Spring in brief:
1.	Core Container: The core container defines how your beans are created, configured and managed. 	
	BeanFactory, the heart of any Spring-based application is found in the Core container. 

2. 	Application Context: is a configuration file that provides context information to the Spring 
	framework. The Spring context includes enterprise services such as JNDI, EJB, e-mail, 
	internalization, validation, and scheduling functionality.

3.	AOP module: supports for aspect-oriented programming. It helps us to interoperate between Spring 
	and other AOP frameworks.

4.	JDBC and DAO: provides accessiblity to databases.

5.	O/R Mapping: module helps us to integrate ORM frameworks like Hibernate,JDO,iBATIS SQL Maps in our 
	Spring project 

6.	Web module: is built on the application context module and provides a context that is appropriate 
	for web-based applications. 

7.	MVC framework: allows us to built MVC web applications.


Installing Spring plugins in eclipse
1.	Go go the help ---> Install new Software
2.	Enter the url "http://www.springide.org/updatesite"
3.	Choose the ones that you need else choose everything 
4. 	Install

Creating and running simple program in Spring.

1.	File
2.	New
3.	Java Project (No need to select for Spring Project or Dynamic Project and all)
4. 	Give any name of the Project (say SpringDemo).
5.	Finish.
6.	In your project, you will just have 'src' and 'JRE System Library'.
7.	Create a folder called 'lib' inside SpringDemo, in the same level of src.
8.	Put all the spring jars in this 'lib' folder.
9.	Select all the jars, right click, add to build path.
10.	Now in a src folder create any pojo class, say Student as follows:

	package com.avishek;

	public class Student {
		String name;
		int age;
		public String getName() {
			return name;
		}
		public void setName(String name) {
			this.name = name;
		}
		public int getAge() {
			return age;
		}
		public void setAge(int age) {
			this.age = age;
		}
	}

11. Now create a Spring Bean Configuration File in the source ('src') folder. 
	Say we take the name of this file as "student", then student.xml file is generated,having 
	contents as:
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans 
		http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">
	</beans>

12. Now add the bean properties as follows:
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
	<beans xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
		xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
		xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans 
		http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">
		<bean id="studentBean" class = "com.avishek.Student">
			<property name="name" value = "Avishek Gurung"> </property>
			<property name="age" value = "25"></property>
		</bean>
	</beans>

13. Now create a class containing main method anywhere within 'src' folder as shown:
	package com.avishek;
	import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;
	import com.avishek.Student;

	public class Main {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context  = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("student.xml");
			Student s = (Student)context.getBean("studentBean");
			System.out.println(s.getName());
		}
	}

14. Run it to get the required result.
