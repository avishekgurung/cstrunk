SOME CONFIGURATION WITH ECLIPSE

1. SERVER CONFIGURATION

	a. Download any apache-tomcat version and keep it in some location.
	b. In Eclipse, goto Windows -> Preferences -> Server -> Runtime Environment
	c. Click Add -> Select the apache tomcat version that you have dowloaded -> Browse and give the installation directory (directory where it is kept) -> Finish

	We have successfully added the server in Eclipse. Now we need to add our project in the server and run the server.

	d. goto Windows -> Show View -> Servers
	e. You will be able to find the list of servers that you have added. If no servers are there then you will have an option to create a new server.
	f. So now create a new server, server's name and host name will appear automatically.
	g. Click next and add your project from available to configured box. 
	h. Now the recently added server will appear in the list.
	i. Right Click -> Start (the status will now be changed to Started, Synchronized)

	Now if you have not create the Project yet and just want to test the server. Create a simple dummy server as follows:

	a. File -> New -> Dynamic Web Project
	b. If web.xml file is not generated, create and add it inside WEB-INF
	c. Create one JSP file inside WebContent folder.
	d. Right Click Project -> Run As -> Server -> Next -> Next ->Finish
	e. hit http://localhost:8080/ToDelete/blah.jsp


2. Spring MVC Project Structure
	
	The folder and the files structure of Spring MVC and J2EE Project that we create in Java is the same.

	The structure is as follows:

    ProjectName
	|
	|-----Java Resources------src-----Cotains all our .java files
	|
	|-----WebContent----------WEB-INF------lib---All jar files
	|                                  |
	|                                  |---web.xml
    
	
	here we can write any JSPs inside WebContent Folder
     
    This structure follows the one that I used for Asho project where all jsp and other files are properly protected from directly accessing from url.

    ProjectName
	|
	|-----Java Resources------src-----Cotains all our .java files
	|
	|-----WebContent------|----WEB-INF-------lib---All jar files
	|                     |              |
    |                     |              |---web.xml
    |                     |              |---JSP---All Jsp files
    |                     |             
    |                     |----images----All image files
    |                     |----JS--------All javascript files
    |                     |----CSS-------All Cascading Sheets
