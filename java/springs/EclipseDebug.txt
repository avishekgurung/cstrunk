ECLIPSE DEBUG

1. Error Encountered: Spring MVC Rest: No mapping found for HTTP request with URI [/ecommerce-api/rest/checkout] in 
DispatcherServlet in Spring MVC Application. Web page was not getting displayed.

Sol. No class was generated of the java file that was there in src folder. In project tab, there is an option of 
"Build Automatically", that should be checked.

2. Server Tomcat v7.0 Server at localhost failed to start

Sol. a. Goto ur workspace directory
Goto <workspace-directory>\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.resources
and delete .snap file

Remember these are all hidden files so we need to use ls -a to view them
	
	b. Goto <workspace-directory>\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.wst.server.core
		delete tmp folder

Once the above steps are done, restart the eclipse

Else if none of the above works, deleting the server and creating again new server could help.


3. exception is org.apache.commons.dbcp.SQLNestedException: Cannot load JDBC driver class 'com.mysql.jdbc.Driver

Sol. MYSQL connector J jar not present or not added to the classpath

4. Could not get JDBC Connection; nested exception is org.apache.commons.dbcp.SQLNestedException: Cannot create 
PoolableConnectionFactory

Sol. Make sure that the sql server is running. You can run the server in linux by using the commandservice mysql
start. Also, the database name, username and password should be correct.
