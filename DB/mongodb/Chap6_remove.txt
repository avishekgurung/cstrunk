REMOVING

	The syntax for removing the documents are as follows:
	db.COLLECTION_NAME.remove(DELLETION_CRITTERIA)

	if no deletion criteria is given then mongo will delete all the documents from the collection.

	if we want to delete only one record then we need to specify 1 after deletion_criteria

	a. db.employee.remove({"phone":"HTC"});
		deletes document from employee collection where name is HTC.

	b. db.employee.remove({"phone":"HTC"},1);
		deletes only first document that satisfies the above criteria.
