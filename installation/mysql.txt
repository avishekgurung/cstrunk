MYSQL INSTALLATION

For Linux, we download from terminal. But for Windows, we need to download the ".msi" file. As this is the  executable file 
and all the wizards for installation comes here. 
I downloaded from "http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file.php?id=454873".

Installation
1. Just use the "msi" file and follow the wizard to install the mysql.
2. Note that for windows, we are using "msi" executable file to install.
3. Now in the terminal, type "mysql"
4. If the command is not recognized, then we need to set the path (follow setting path)
5. Else "mysql -u root -p" , and then the correct password will allow us to login.

There are couple of steps that I did to set the path and I have set couple of paths. And finally it worked.
But what I would suggest is, after completing every step, do "refresh" in desktop and after that open new command
prompt and then try in that command prompt. So some steps, I might have done un-necessary also.

Setting the path
1. Once the mysql is installed, a mysql folder will be generated in Program Files.
2. Go to the bin directory and copy the path.
3. Now like that of Java path setting, go to enviroment variables section, and use the above said bin path in user variable 
   section.
4. Refresh and check properly in new command prompt
5. If not working, set this same path in system variable section in "path" value.
6. Refresh and check properly in new commadn prompt.
7. If not working, create new system variable with the name "MYSQL_HOME" and give the value as "bin" path and then check.
8. We will be able to login into mysql through command prompt.
