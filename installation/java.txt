Installing Java in Windows

1. Go to the oracle link and download the latest exe file for java w.r.t to ur OS
2. Install it just by clicking the exe file.
3. Once installed, the folder called "java" will be formed in Program Files.
4. Inside this folder we have JDK and JRE folders.

Now we need to set the path

1. my computer -> properties -> advanced system properties -> environment variables
2. In the user variable, see there is any varible with the name "path".
3. If its there, edit it if not create it, and add the location of jdk bin.
4. In my case its located in "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin"
5. So just add "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin\", see \ is added at last
6. if "path" variable is already present and some values are already there, then edit it
   add "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_25\bin\;". Remember colon ";" is added for seperator.
7. go to desktop and REFRESH 
8. Now "java" and "javac" will give output in prompt.

If this does not work, try adding same path in the "path" variable of system variables too.
